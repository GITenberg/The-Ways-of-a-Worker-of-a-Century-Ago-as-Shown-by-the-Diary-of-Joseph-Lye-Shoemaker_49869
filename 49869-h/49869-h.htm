<h2>THE WAYS OF A WORKER OF A CENTURY AGO<br />
<small><em>As Shown by the Diary of Joseph Lye, Shoemaker.</em></small></h2>
</div>

<p>For all the facts in this little book the writer is indebted to
Henry F. Tapley, who gave the Lye, or Tapley, shoe shop to the Essex
Institute, and who related the record of it, as well as extracts from
the diary of Joseph Lye, to the Lynn Historical Society, October 14,
<a name="stop" id="stop"></a><ins title="Stop omitted in original">1915.</ins></p>

<p>Mr. Tapley’s story is published in the Register of the Lynn Historical
Society, Number XIX, for the Year 1915.</p>


<h3>JOSEPH LYE HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>Joseph Lye was born in Lynn, Mass., in 1792, being one of the nine sons
of Joseph Lye, a shoemaker and soldier of the Revolution, and Ann Hart.
He kept a diary which shows that he “was first clerk of the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Congregational church (Unitarian), clerk of the Fire club, served
as juryman, trained in the militia, watched with sick friends and
neighbors. He was something of a traveler in his modest way, worked as
a shoemaker, painter, fisherman and skipper, and sailed small boats. He
cleaned the chimney, set out posts and fences, fixed the pump, caulked
boats and helped kill the neighbor’s pig. Interested in religious
matters, he led the active, useful life of a good citizen.”</p>

<p>Altogether, he was a busy man. He viewed life from many angles. His
diary is doubtless a good and accurate record of the acts and thoughts
of the average man of his time. It furnishes material for contrast with
men and their ways of these days.</p>

<p>In Lye’s time all work was done by hand. Machinery was scarcely known.
Men often worked alone, for the factory system had not been started. As
they toiled in solitude they read from a book or meditated in silence.
They were given to deep thinking.</p>

<p>He lived in extraordinary times. His father told him of the Revolution.
Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> Hamilton and Jefferson were laying the foundations of the
new nation. Pioneers were pushing their way west. Inventors were busy.
Fulton sailed the Clermont down the Hudson. Inventors dreamed of the
steam locomotive. American ships opened trade with the Far East and
brought back “the wealth of the Indies.” The nation had prospered so
much that it had a surplus in the treasury.</p>

<p>The shoe business flourished. John Adam Dagyr, “the Celebrated
Shoemaker of Essex,” had taught his fellow workers of Lynn how to make
shoes equal to the best imported from London and Paris. Newspapers
of the time urged people to buy American shoes instead of imported
footwear. Ebenezer Breed, an early captain of American industry, had
induced Congress to put a protective tariff on American shoes.</p>

<p>Joseph Lye, the diarist, learned shoemaking of his father, the
Revolutionary soldier, as did many a lad of his time. He worked on the
farm, too, and became a handy man, able to undertake most any of the
simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span> tasks of his time. He was content to work industriously and
to live thriftily. Ambition did not tempt him. He thought deeply upon
matters of religion. The Puritan conscience then was alive. He kept a
diary. Its records are a good standard by which to compare the acts and
thoughts of an average man of a century ago with the acts and thoughts
of an average man of today, should any reader desire to do so.</p>


<h3>JOSEPH LYE’S SHOP.</h3>

<p>Soon after his return from the war of the Revolution, Joseph Lye bought
a parcel of land and buildings thereon near the Common in Lynn, paying
123 pounds, 6 shillings for the entire property.</p>

<p>Among the buildings was a small, sturdy structure, scarcely as large
as a kitchen. In it were four “berths,” or seats, on which shoemakers
sat, their tools by their side and their stock on the floor, making
shoes by hand. It was heated by a wood stove and lighted by candles,
but aside from these it was as primitive as an old barn and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> none
of the hundred and one devices so essential to the modern factory. It
had no steam, no machinery, not even running water. But it sufficed
for the times. In it the Lyes made a comfortable living, first Joseph
Lye, shoemaker and soldier of the Revolution, and then his son, Joseph,
shoemaker and diarist.</p>

<p>This shop passed from the Lye family by purchase to Amos Preston
Tapley, a shoe merchant, related to the Lyes by marriage. From him it
passed to his son, Henry F. Tapley, who gave it to the Essex Institute
in Salem. Here it is preserved as an example of an early type of
American shoe factory.</p>


<h3>JOSEPH LYE’S RELIGION.</h3>

<p>Lye began his diary by writing:</p>

<p>“A Diary of my Daily occupations and a few remarks that do not
relate to them, and a record of what deaths and marriages come to my
knowledge.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="outdent">“Let not ambition mock my useful toil,</div>
<div class="line indent1">My humble joys and destiny obscure,</div>
<div class="line">Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile</div>
<div class="line indent1">The simple annals of the poor.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Lye thought much upon spiritual matters. He wrote in his diary
frequently of his attendance at church and of his views of religious
subjects. He worked leisurely and had time to reflect upon the meaning
of life and its highest ideals. It may be his view of life has been
lost among men of today, intent upon their affairs of the moment. The
point is worth looking into, for the solution of many serious problems
of business, labor and society is coming through Christianity and its
interpretation by men.</p>

<p>Lye wrote in his diary many records of his acts and views of
Christianity, and some of his records are these:</p>

<p>“Sunday, Nov. 23. This day attended the meeting at the meeting house
in Lynn, heard Rev. Mr. Brown preach from Luke 23, 61&ndash;62 verse. In the
afternoon from Matthew 26, 24&ndash;27 verse.”</p>

<p>Lye went to church twice Sunday. Many of today do not go to church once.</p>

<p>“Sunday, Nov. 30. Rainy and warm. In the forenoon attended public
worship, heard Mr. Brown, of Charlestown, preach a sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span> from 2
Corinthians, 2 chapter, 15th verse and part of 16th. In the afternoon
from Paul 39, 4th verse.”</p>

<p>Rain did not keep Lye from going to church twice. Rain keeps many a
churchgoer away from church these days.</p>

<p>“Thursday, Dec. 25. Christmas. Rev. Hosea Ballou was installed pastor
of the Second Universalist meeting in Boston.”</p>

<p>Christmas Day and no mention of Christmas joys. Puritans frowned on
Christmas celebrations. Lye knew no Christmas cheer as do people of
these days.</p>

<p>“Sunday, Jan. 18th. Read one of Laurin’s sermons in the forenoon. In
the afternoon attended divine worship in Chelsea. Heard an excellent
sermon by the Rev. Mr. Tuckerman.”</p>

<p>Lye could not go to church Sunday morning, so he read a sermon. Men of
today read the newspapers Sunday morning, or play golf, or motor.</p>

<p>“Jan. 1, 1818. Fine day for the new year. Walked on foot to Chelsea,
engaged a seat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a><br /><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> Capt. John Tewkesbury in Rev. Mr. Tuckerman’s
meeting house.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_008.jpg" width="500" height="344" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE TAPLEY OR LYE SHOE SHOP OF A CENTURY AGO</p></div>
</div>

<p>Lye walked to Chelsea, a distance of eight miles, to church. Few of
today will walk a mile to church.</p>

<p>A time of woe to Lye was in February and March of 1818, when he
recorded in his diary:</p>

<p>“Sunday, Feb. 22. Attended public worship at the old meeting house.
Sermon by Rev. Mr. Morse, son of D. Morse, of Charlestown, from the
passage, ‘Be ye reconciled to God.’ The sermon was the true essence of
Calvinism, very uncharitable, cruel as the grave, profitable to no one.”</p>

<p>“Mar. 22. Staid at home this day, rather than to hear a Calvinistic
preacher at the First church.”</p>

<p>Lye was evidently a man of strong convictions.</p>

<p>A time of joy to him was in the early part of the year 1822, when
he helped to form a Congregational church at Lynn and worked on its
meeting house. He records:</p>

<p>“Tuesday, Nov. 5. Assisted in erecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> two stages for the
accommodation of the committee, clergymen and singers for the
dedication of the new meeting house.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon was laid the corner stone of the Second
Congregational church (Unitarian) with appropriate ceremony. The
treasurer, William Badger, having deposited under it a 25 cent piece,
one half cent, a ten cent piece, an American coin and some newspapers
of the day, and the copper plate with the inscription: ‘There is one
God, one mediator between God and man, the man Jesus Christ. God
is no respector of persons but in every nation he that feareth Him
and worketh righteousness is acceptable.’ The other side: ‘Second
Congregational society of Lynn, maintaining in their fullest extent the
right of conscience and private judgment in Religion and the principles
of Universal Charity was established, and this house devoted to the
worship of the only true God, the Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
founded under their patronage in the year of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> Christian Era 1822.
May God give thee increase.’”</p>

<p>Deep interest in religion was common among shoemakers of the time of
Lye. The Bible was kept in many a shop. The Sunday sermon was a chief
topic of debate among the shoemakers. The minister himself often called
at the shop. But these days there is no room in the shop for the Bible
and the minister never calls. There may be business wisdom in the
remark of a shoe man that each large manufacturing organization should
have a minister on its staff.</p>


<h3>THE WAGES OF JOSEPH LYE.</h3>

<p>For his useful toil Joseph Lye was content with a modest wage. He was
willing to turn <a name="his" id="his"></a><ins title="Original has has">his</ins> hand to most anything. He worked “as a
shoemaker, painter, fisherman and skipper of small boats. He cleaned
the chimney, set out posts, built fences, fixed the pump,
<a name="caulked" id="caulked"></a><ins title="Original has calked">caulked</ins> boats
and helped kill the neighbor’s pig.” He also was a farmer. Evidently
he had a good all around training which enabled him to adjust himself
to the circumstances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> each day. He did not become a specialist in
shoemaking and limit his work to one branch of the shoe trade, as do
shoemakers of these days. He undertook most any work that came before
him. Yet he was not a plodder, living from day to day, for he took upon
himself responsible tasks and financial obligations. For example, in
April, 1822, he agreed to pay his mother $150 a year for the use of the
farm, comprising eight acres of tillage, two cows, a pasture and a wood
lot, as well as buildings.</p>

<p>He was taught his trade of shoemaking by his father, Joseph Lye, the
cordwainer and soldier of the Revolution. In turn he taught his brother
Robert to make shoes. He made mention of it in his diary. He was not
apprenticed to a master workman for seven years, or until he was 21, as
was the common practice of his time. His knack of painting, building
fences, fishing, sailing boats, and farming was picked up in his
boyhood life on his father’s farm. A task came before him. His father
showed him how to do it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span> did it, and learned a lesson in the school
of experience.</p>

<p>He made frequent entries about his wages in his diary. For example:</p>

<p>“Tuesday, Nov. 25. Made 3 pairs of shoes at 40 cents. Assisted in
throwing up shop wood. Pleasant and cold.”</p>

<p>His earnings for that day were $1.20. Besides, he made fuel ready for
the winter. The fuel was from the wood lot on the Lye farm. The labor
of gathering it was its chief cost. He never dreamed of a time when a
fuel administrator would limit supplies of fuel to people.</p>

<p>“Wed., Nov. 26. Made two pairs of village walking boots at 45 cents;
two pairs military at 40 cents. Weather continues clear and pretty
cold.”</p>

<p>His earnings for this day were $1.70. Business was brisk with him.
Clear cold weather must have started people buying winter footwear.</p>

<p>“Friday, Nov. 28. Hauled the boat Ann into winter quarters, stripped
her. Assisted Amos Tapley to get his boards in. Waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> some time for
shoes. Made one pair at 45 cents. Weather warm and cloudy.”</p>

<p>His earnings this day from shoemaking were but 45 cents. Whether Amos
Tapley paid him for getting in boards, or whether he just helped in a
neighborly way is a matter he does not make clear in his diary. The
ship Ann belonged to him. So he had no pay for his work on it.</p>

<p>“Saturday, Nov. 29. Made 2 pairs of shoes at 45 cents. This week’s work
comes to $5.87 exclusive of other work.”</p>

<p>Five dollars and 87 cents for a week’s work in shoemaking! Some
shoemakers earn that in a day these times. It was a normal week’s wage
for Lye. The next Saturday he records: “This week’s work amount to
$5.40.” It was less than $1 a day. Small pay that seems. But $1 went
a lot farther then than these days. Lye’s costs of living were low.
He farmed and fished and produced much of his own food stuffs, and
gathered his own fuel. His “humble joys” were by no means expensive. He
speaks of taking a book of sermons from the library, of going to camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
meeting, and of walking to Boston to attend a theatre. Nothing very
expensive in these.</p>

<p>Lye speaks of earning $5.87 “exclusive of other work.” Evidently he had
some source of income besides his pay for making shoes. Perhaps Amos
Tapley paid him for helping to get in his boards. Later he “assisted
Amos Tapley to repair wood shop.” And Saturday, Jan. 3, he records that
“Hugh Floyd and his boy Isaac moved into our shop.” Doubtless they paid
rent and he had an income as a landlord.</p>

<p>His ventures in fishing paid him well. He records:</p>

<p>“Friday, Sept. 2. Caught 750 fish about two miles southeast of Nahant.”</p>

<p>A great haul that was. Plenty of food. Yet not much money, for fish was
cheap, selling at six cents a pound, or thereabouts. He followed up
fishing during the summer season. In addition to the profits from it
he had a bounty of $35 for engaging in the codfish industry for four
months. He records that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a><br /><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> to collect that bounty he “went on foot to
Marblehead.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="500" height="344" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">INSIDE THE TAPLEY OR LYE SHOE SHOP OF A CENTURY AGO</p></div>
</div>

<p>Plainly Lye was a diligent, thrifty worker, willing to work in the
sweat of his brow and to walk a long journey to collect his pay. But
his ways are no more. Modern industry has changed the habits of men.</p>


<h3>THE MISCELLANEOUS TASKS OF JOSEPH LYE.</h3>

<p>The spring of the year 1819 was a very busy time with Lye, and a few
entries in his diary reveal the versatility of his career.</p>

<p>May 5, “helped set fence in front of our premises in the forenoon.
Performed military duty in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>May 9, “helped move Mudge’s new shop. Went to Chelsea to purchase pigs,
but found none to be bought.”</p>

<p>Saturday, May 23, he “trained again.”</p>

<p>June 30, “sailed from this town for North Yarmouth in the sloop Jane,
Capt. Ross, for the purpose of recovering the boat Humbird, which Ellis
and myself sold to David Libby last November.”</p>

<p>Sunday, July 12, “arrived in Lynn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> the boat, which we took
possession of July 1 without much difficulty, having had a quick voyage
of ten days, Capt. Ross, S. Hutchinson and myself being all the crew to
manage both vessels.”</p>

<p>Monday, July 27, “bought of James Austin one sixth part of the boat
Humbird for $16.66.” (It was for using this boat in the cod fishing
industry that Lye got the bounty of $35, by the way.)</p>

<p>At some time or other during the year, Lye acquired the pigs for which
he made his vain trip to Chelsea, and on Jan. 1 he “killed our two
hogs. Their weight was 384 pounds.”</p>

<p>The variety of Lye’s tasks certainly surpasses those of the average
shoemaker of these days.</p>


<h3>THE PASTIMES OF JOSEPH LYE.</h3>

<p>Joseph Lye lived a well rounded life. Besides shoemaking, fishing and
farming, and other occupations that came to his hand, he trained with
the militia, ran with the firemen, took part in politics, and sat up
with sick friends, and lent a hand when help was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> needed. He took
life seriously, not as sternly as did his Puritan forefathers, but
nevertheless, with a deep and earnest purpose. For example, in his
diary he records:</p>

<p>“Monday, Mar. 20. This day I am 27 years old. I have, through God’s
goodness, been spared in life and health for another year, and may I
improve the present year better than I have ever done before.”</p>

<p>At the close of the same year he records:</p>

<p>“This day closes the year through which I have passed in good health
and have enjoyed all the necessary comforts which I have needed. May I
be suitably thankful for mercies received.”</p>

<p>No birthday dinners and celebrations for Lye. The passing years of life
were serious to him.</p>

<p>Yet Lye was not a sombre soul, given to overmuch piety. Jan. 2, 1823,
finds him going to Boston in Breed’s carriage, with three friends, a
big event in his career, for he usually walked to Boston, a journey
of ten miles or so. In the afternoon Lye and his friends attended
the theatre and saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> comedy “Who Wants a Guinea” acted. He makes
no criticism of that show. That is unlucky. It would be interesting
to know what he thought of the show. He was a keen critic, given to
speaking his mind, for, on the day after the laying of the church
corner stone he records in his diary that “On searching under the
corner stone a quarter of a dollar and one half cent was missing,
purloined by some <a name="sacrilegious" id="sacrilegious"></a><ins title="Original has sacriligious">sacrilegious</ins> robber.”</p>

<p>Lye liked dancing, for he records:</p>

<p>“Feb. 3. In the evening attended a public dance at the hotel, under the
direction of Mr. Jameson, who is teacher in the school. Much pleased
with the performance.”</p>

<p>A little later he records that he:</p>

<p>“Attended the town meeting. High party spirit is again revived, and has
destroyed the good feeling which has for a number of years prevailed in
town.”</p>

<p>But that spell of bad feeling among townsmen passed, and July 4, 1821,
finds Lye recording:</p>

<p>“Independence Day was celebrated by the citizens without distinction
of party. Oration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> in the Methodist meeting house by Rev. E. Mudge.
Procession by Artillery and Light Infantry. Dinner at hotel. Devoted
this day to celebration.”</p>

<p>Lye was always ready to do his part in the public service. He mentions
his service in the militia several times, and once remarked that he
“trained near Rum Rock, in Danvers.”</p>

<p>Certainly Lye’s pleasures in life were simple. He had a lot of
satisfaction in performing his duties as a citizen and as a neighbor.</p>


<h3>JOSEPH LYE AS A NEIGHBOR.</h3>

<p>In a neighborly way Lye did many things, helping to fix fences, to mend
boats, to kill pigs, to repair pumps, and to do any of the kind deeds
that help a neighbor along the path of life.</p>

<p>Two records from his diary show what a kindly neighbor he was:</p>

<p>“May 4, 1820. Watched this night with our neighbor, David Farrington,
who, it is feared, is approaching the last end.”</p>

<p>“Mar. 30, 1823. Watched last night with Thomas Cheever, who is bereft
of his senses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>A good and kindly neighbor was Lye, to watch with the sick.</p>


<h3>THE MEANING OF LIFE TO JOSEPH LYE.</h3>

<p>The sum of Lye’s view of life is found in this entry in his diary:</p>

<p>“Friday, Sept. 2. Carried out a fishing party. Capt. Z. Atwell, S.
Smith and six others. On our return off Bass Neck, Capt. Atwell at the
helm, going before the wind, the boom jibed over and knocked Matthew
Breed Jr. overboard. I jumped into the small boat and picked him up.
He was considerable distance astern and quite exhausted, just ready to
sink. Thus was I a feeble instrument in God’s hands.”</p>

<p>That was his view of life. “A feeble instrument in God’s hands.” In
that spirit he pursued his useful toil, enjoyed his humble joys, and
wrote his simple annals of the poor. His ways were the ways of other
days, and will be known no more.</p>


<h3>JOSEPH LYE’S EPITAPH.</h3>

<p>After the death of Joseph Lye, his family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> placed a stone on his grave,
bearing this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">In Memory of<br />
MR. JOSEPH LYE,<br />
who died<br />
April 10, 1834,<br />
Aged 42 Years.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">Receive, O earth, his faded form,</div>
<div class="line indent1">In thy cold bosom let it lie;</div>
<div class="line">Safe let it rest from every storm,</div>
<div class="line indent1">Soon may it rise, no more to die.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So that stone tells of the faith Lye had in eternal life, a faith which
was his guide in each act of the days of his life.</p>


<h3>THE TAPLEYS.</h3>

<p>Amos Tapley, who purchased the Lye shop after the death of Joseph Lye,
was of the Danvers family of Tapleys. He married a daughter of Joseph
Lye, the shoemaker and soldier of the Revolution. His son, Amos Preston
Tapley, engaged in the shoe trade and became the owner of the shop upon
the death of his father. His son, Henry Fuller Tapley, became owner
of the shop, and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> it to the Essex Institute. Henry F. Fuller is
surviving partner of the house of Amos P. Tapley &amp; Co., whose record is
this:</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
PROFIT AND LOSS.</h3>

<p>Lye didn’t live long, didn’t make money, didn’t make a reputation,
didn’t build up a big business, didn’t go into politics, didn’t follow
any sports as a fad, and didn’t break into society. But it looks as if
he enjoyed life while he lived.</p>

<p>Lye was contented to work for a living, to live in simple fashion, and
to enjoy humble pleasures. He had a knack of getting along. When the
shoe trade was dull he turned his hand to something else. He kept down
his cost of living, for he farmed, fished and raised a pig. If anything
around the house or shop needed repairs, he did it himself. He was an
independent person. Yet he wasn’t selfish. He was always ready to give
a helping hand to his neighbors.</p>

<p>He read the Book of Life, and believed it, according to his views. He
lived <a name="according" id="according"></a><ins title="Original has acccording">according</ins> to his conscience, and he was a contented
man through the days of his life.</p>

<p>Did he get more out of life than a fellow these days of complex ways.
Who knows?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
